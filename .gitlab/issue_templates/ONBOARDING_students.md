## Brief introduction of the new team member

This is of course completely up to you. Feel free to share with us whatever you like, e.g. your name (field of study, prior experience with coding). We known that at this point you are probably familiar with your topic yet, but no worries, just give us a high level description that you got from your supervisor.

## For newbies
We bombarded you with a lot of information and we know that it can be overwhelming, especially if you are new to Python, Git, GitLab and etc.
Don't worry, we all had to learn this stuff at some point so here are some helpful keywords and links:

#### Git
We use Git for tracking changes of files, i.e. our code.
This way we can work simultaneously in different parts of the code without disturbing others. [Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-git-and-how-to-use-it-c341b049ae61/) is a general introduction to Git.
Also [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE) is an extended video.
Btw, most of this stuff can be done directly trough your IDE of choice.
The simplest way to learn Git is by using it. In doubt ask your supervisor.

#### GitLab
In order to use Git, you actually do not need GitLab.
However, it allows to store your code online and also provides software management and planning tools (similar to Github).
This specific instance is hosted by the LRZ!
Btw you can use LRZ GitLab to store your own projects, e.g. for you written thesis!
[Click here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/gitlab/gitlab_introduction.htm) for some basics. *Please note: If you create a new issue use the corresponding issue template.*
#### Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language written in plain text oftentimes used for README files.
Gitlab issues description are written using a special Markdown flavor.
It is really simple, but it allows for some fancy formatting.
[Here](https://opensource.com/article/19/9/introduction-markdown) is an introduction.
#### Python
If you ended up in this repo, you'll probably end up coding in python.
So [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) is a written introduction and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8) in video form.

#### Linux
QUEENS runs on Linux operating systems.
Don't worry it is not as complicated as it sounds, to be honest there is no big difference to Mac or Windows besides the extended use of the terminal, aka the command line. In the beginning this might seem slower, but trust us, once you master a basic set of commands, it works like a charm!
[Here](https://maker.pro/linux/tutorial/basic-linux-commands-for-beginners) is a simple tutorial on this topic.
*Bonus: If you really want to become a nerd have a look at the [VIM editor](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/getting-started-vim)*.
