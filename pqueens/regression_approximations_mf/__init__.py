"""Multi-Fidelity Regression Approximations.

This package contains a set of multi-fidelits regression approximations,
i.e., multi-task regression models which are the essential building block for
multi-fidelity surrogate models. For the actual implementation of the regression
models external third party libraries are used, such as `GPy`_, `GPFlow`_.
