"""Regression Approximations.

This package contains a set of regression approximations, i.e., regression
models which are the essential building block for surrogate models. For the
actual implementation of the regression models external third party libraries
are used, such as `GPy`_, `GPFlow`_, and `TensorFlow`_.

    * For module TODOs
    * You have to also use ``sphinx.ext.todo`` extension
