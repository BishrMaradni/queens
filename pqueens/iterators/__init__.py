Iterators
------------

The iterator package contains the implementation of several UQ and optimization
methods. Each of which is implemented in their own iterator class. The iterator
is therefor one of the central building blocks, as the iterators orchestrate
the evaluations on one or multiple models. QUEENS also permits nesting of
iterators to enable hierachical methods or surrogate based UQ approaches.
