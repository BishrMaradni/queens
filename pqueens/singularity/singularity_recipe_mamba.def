%help
This is a singularity container containing CentOS7 and Python 3.8 as well as necessary QUEENS
dependencies (Python packages) to run the latter on a HPC cluster. Central elements are a copy
of the Drivers class and the main_remote.py file. This container version uses the MPI environment
and 3rd library packages of the host! Therefore it assumes that a working executable (e.g. BACI) is
already available on the cluster. The advantage of this layout is that that we are always
up-to-date with the cluster infrastructure and just mount important directories and copy system
variables at runtime.
