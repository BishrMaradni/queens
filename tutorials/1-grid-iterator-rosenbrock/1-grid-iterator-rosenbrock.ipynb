    "# Grid iterator on Rosenbrock function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use the grid iterator on the [Rosenbrock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function) function.\n",
    "The Rosenbrock function is a well-known test function from optimization. It serves as the \"computational model\" for this example.\n",
    "The grid iterator evaluates a model based on a grid of the input space.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of using QUEENS:\n",
    "1. you can call it in the terminal with an input file and an output directory: `queens --input <path-to-input> --output_dir <output-path>`.\n",
    "2. you can write a small Python script that you use to run QUEENS.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will follow the second approach and work with the script-based workflow.\n",
    "This allows you to run and interact with QUEENS directly in Jupyter notebooks."
